This repository contains some scripts that we sometimes use to analyze the output
of running icefall training scripts with the --print-diagnostics=True option.
They were written in a quick-and-dirty way and not initially intended for general use.

We are adding them to a repository and making them public without much
documentation; eventually we hope to have time to improve the documentation and
code quality.
